This project is my personal project to get my grips with Python and OpenCV again. I work sporadically on this and post progress.

The grand idea is to have an algorithm that can scan all information on the screen for ALttP and process it to play the game. The grand goal would be to have an AI that can solve an easy randomizer on its own, only using some learned knowledge (no SNES RAM access) and visuals. This will likely take years.
